  { question: "How long does the claim resolution process take?", answer: "The timeline varies based on complexity. Company-level resolutions typically take 30-60 days. Ombudsman cases average 3-6 months. Legal proceedings may take 6-12 months. We provide realistic timelines upfront and push for the fastest possible resolution." },
  { question: "What documents are required to start my case?", answer: "Typically we need: (1) Policy document, (2) Claim rejection/demand letter, (3) Premium payment receipts, (4) Medical records (for health claims), (5) FIR/accident report (for motor claims), and (6) All correspondence with the insurer. Don't worry if you're missing some — we help you obtain them." },
  { question: "What are your fees? Do I pay upfront?", answer: "Yes, We operate on a fixed fee model depending on the complexity of the case. No further fees, charges or surprises thereafter. We also offer a free initial case evaluation." },
  { question: "Do you handle all insurance companies and types?", answer: "Yes. We handle disputes with all IRDAI-registered insurers including LIC, HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential, Star Health, ICICI Lombard, Bajaj Allianz, and 50+ others. We cover Life, Health, Motor, Home, Travel, and General Insurance." },
  { question: "What if my claim was rejected years ago?", answer: "You can approach the Insurance Ombudsman within 1 year of the insurer's final response. For consumer courts, the limitation is 2 years. Even if time has passed, we can explore condonation of delay or alternative remedies. Always worth a consultation." },
  { question: "Is my information secure and confidential?", answer: "Absolutely. We use bank-grade encryption for document transfer and storage. Your information is never shared with third parties without consent. Our legal team operates under strict attorney-client privilege standards." },
